# Morpho Blue — Liquidity Stress Testing Framework

> A Basel III–inspired liquidity stress testing framework applied to Morpho Blue isolated lending markets and MetaMorpho vaults.

**Status**: Phase 0 — methodological draft. Not production-ready. Not investment advice.

---

## Motivation

DeFi lending pools are inherently fragile under stress (Chiu et al., BIS 2023), yet most public risk reporting on DeFi protocols transposes Basel concepts informally. This project formalizes a Basel III–equivalent liquidity stress framework for Morpho Blue, with two contributions:

1. An explicit on-chain analogue of the **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)** and **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**, with stated mapping limitations.
2. A first quantitative measure of **MetaMorpho curator risk discipline** — the gap between observed allocation and the allocation that minimizes 30-day liquidity Value-at-Risk under the framework.

The work is calibrated on the April 2026 KelpDAO event as a primary stress anchor, alongside the March 2023 USDC depeg and the May 2022 stETH discount.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Methodological note (`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`) | ✅ v0.2 |
| **1** | Stress scenario formalization (`docs/SCENARIOS.md`) | ✅ v0.1 |
| **2** | Data acquisition architecture (`docs/DATA.md`) + storage layer + tests | ✅ partial — architecture done, fetch scripts as skeletons |
| **3** | Modeling: LCR_onchain, NSFR_conditional, slippage model, MC | ⏳ pending |
| **4** | Historical backtest (KelpDAO + 2 secondary events) | ⏳ pending |
| **5** | Forward-looking stress on top-5 markets | ⏳ pending |
| **6** | Public deliverables (Dune dashboard, Mirror article, X thread) | ⏳ pending |

## Quick start (Phase 2 architecture)

```bash
# Install
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the test suite (17 tests, ~2s)
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -v

# Set up local config
cp config.yaml config.local.yaml  # then edit to add secrets via env vars
```

## How to read this repo (for reviewers / employers)

If you have **5 minutes**: read [`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`](./docs/METHODOLOGY.md) §1–2 and §4. That is the entire intellectual contribution at the methodology layer.

If you have **30 minutes**: read the full methodology note and skim the bibliography in [`docs/references.md`](./docs/references.md) to assess the academic grounding.

If you have **2 hours**: clone the repo (when implementation phases land), reproduce the dashboard end-to-end from `scripts/`, and verify the stress test on the KelpDAO replay scenario.

## Methodological positioning

| Reference | Approach | Our positioning |
|---|---|---|
| Gauntlet, Chaos Labs | Agent-based simulation of liquidations | We are simpler (deterministic stress shocks at empirical quantiles) and explicitly acknowledge this gap; targeted as v1. |
| LlamaRisk, Block Analitica | Descriptive risk reports per market | We provide an explicit Basel mapping and a falsifiable hypothesis structure that they do not. |
| Chiu et al. (BIS 2023) | Theoretical model of DeFi run dynamics | We are empirical / applied; their model justifies our framework's relevance but our work is implementation-oriented. |
| Steakhouse Financial | Vault-curator centric | Our hypothesis 2 explicitly targets curator risk discipline as a quantifiable gap — a question they engage with operationally but do not formalize. |
